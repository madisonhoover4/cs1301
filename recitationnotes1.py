# there are three types of Booleans
    # Assignment
        # ____ = 0
    #Comparison
        # use the operators: <=, <, >, >=
    #Logical
        # AND - only when both conditions are true
        # OR
        # NOT


# when you make a float an integer, it just casts the decimal off
    # int(7.9999) = 7


# order of operations follows (), **, * / // %, + -

# parameter: a name used inside the finction to refer to the values passed...
# into the function as arguments

#argument: value passed into func from outside the func

# if you don't have a return to a function, the function itself has no value
# this is called none type
# you can still have the function print something, but printing also has a...
# value of none type

def test2():
    print("Hi")

y = test2()

# type(y) = nonetype

# an if statement evaluates to a boolean true false
      
if (var == 3)

elif # is a merger of else and if

# you don't necessarily need else or elif, you can have if on its own
